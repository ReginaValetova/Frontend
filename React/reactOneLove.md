# React

## Introducing JSX

Consider this variable declaration:

```JS
const element = <h1>Hello, world ^.^</h1>
```

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

### Embedding Expressions in JSX

You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.

In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an __'<h1>'__ element.

```JS
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### JSX is an Expression Too

```JS
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```

### Specifying Attributes with JSX
You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```JS
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```
You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

```JS 
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```
Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.

### Specifying Children with JSX
If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with __'/>'__, like XML:
```JS
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```
JSX tags may contain children:

```JS
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
```

### JSX Represents Objects
Babel compiles JSX down to __JS React.createElement()__ calls.

These two examples are identical:

```JX
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```

```JS
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```
React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```JS
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.
